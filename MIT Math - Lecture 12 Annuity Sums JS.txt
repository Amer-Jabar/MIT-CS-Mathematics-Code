// Question: Would you prefer 1 Million Dollars now, or 50,000 Dollars forever with the interest rate of 0.06?
// Answer: The first choice, because the second one converges at about 833,000 Dollars when N approaches infinity. N = Number of years passed

let pay = 50000;
let total = 0;
const rate = 0.06;

let getPaid = () => {
    total += pay;
    pay -= pay * rate;

    return { total, pay };
}

console.log(getPaid());
